## Design Notes

### Validation
- Inputs validated with Zod schemas
- Validation occurs both client-side (feedback) and server-side (security)

### SSR vs Client Rendering
- **SSR**: Pages needing authentication or data fetching
- **Client**: Inline editing, status updates, and notes interactions

### Ownership Enforcement
- Users can only access/modify their own leads
- Admins can access all leads
- Enforced at API route and database query level

---

## Security

- **Authentication**: Secure login with NextAuth
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Ownership**: Users can only access their own leads
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated using Zod schemas
